1. Use RSat to solve the SAT instance obtained above. Is the instance satisfiable?

No, the SAT instance obtained from converting the graph coloring problem contained in 
graph1.txt with 3 colors is not satisfiable.

2. Do the conversion again, this time, with 4 colors. Use RSat to solve this new SAT 
instance. Is the instance satisfiable?

Yes, the new SAT instance obtained from converting the graph coloring problem  
contained in graph1.txt with 4 colors is satisfiable.

3. What do the answers of these two SAT instances tell you about the graph coloring 
problem of the above graph? Can you give a solution (a coloring) to the graph coloring 
problem of the above graph based on the results of RSat?

The answers of the two SAT instances tell us that there does not exist a solution to the 
graph coloring problem contained in graph1.txt using only 3 colors, but there does exist  
a solution(s) using 4 colors. One possible solution to the graph coloring problem is as 
follows: 

Given colors 1 (red), 2 (green), 3 (blue), and 4 (yellow), 

Node 1 gets color 1 (red)
Node 2 gets color 2 (green)
Node 3 gets color 3 (blue)
Node 4 gets color 4 (yellow)
Node 5 gets color 2 (green)
Node 6 gets color 3 (blue)
Node 7 gets color 4 (yellow)

4. Now, use a similar approach to solve the graph coloring of the graph described in 
graph2.txt. What is the minimum number of colors required to properly color this 
graph?

Using a similar approach to solve the graph coloring problem contained in graph2.txt, 
I found that the minimum number of colors required to properly color this graph is 8. 
I converted the graph coloring to SAT instances using 4, 5, 6, and 7 colors and used 
RSat to solve them, until I found that 8 colors provided a satisfiable SAT instance as 
indicated by RSat.
